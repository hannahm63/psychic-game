// computer generates random letter
    // is an array needed here? if so, it will need a math.floor(math.random() * array.length)

// user guesses a letter
    // this will be a document.onkeyup event

// user's guess is documented in the "guesses so far" line

// guesses left decreases by 1

// if the user's guess === the computer's guess then wins increases by 1

// if guesses left reaches 0, losses increases by 1 and computer's letter is displayed
